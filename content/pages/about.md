Born in Italy, moved to Colombia, Bogota' and then to Czech Republic, Brno, I've passed from IT in high school to humanistic studies and languages in the years afterwards, getting from teaching to being academic director in a language school. 

Back in Europe my love for IT rised again, and during my years as application support engineer I self learnt development, working on personal and professional projects (automation webtools).
