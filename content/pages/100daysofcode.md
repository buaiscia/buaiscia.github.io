after some past rough days at work I finally had time to move forward a little with a tutorial project with #TypeScript 

Halfway of it.

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-27<br>
<span>R2 D81</span></p> 

- Got the (translated) contract for my new job and gave resignation letter to my actual job  Partying face Can't wait to start!

- did some #TypeScript but not much as I was full of work. Maybe later tonight.

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-23<br>
<span>R2 D80</span></p> 

finally finished the theory in #typescript with decorators. At least I know how they work even though I'll use some library with them installed already.

Time to practice now, finally!!

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-21<br>
<span>R2 D78-79</span></p> 

grouping as didn't have much time for family 'business', but learnt:
Generics (was waiting for them!) + type casting + other stuff from #typescript

can't wait to finish this to start using it! 
it'll need lots of practice 

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-18<br>
<span>R2 D77</span></p> 

2 hours cleaning, 1h walk, 1h gardening
finished learning about interfaces in #typescript 

helped one person on #freeCodeCamp with #css media queries within minutes (would have never been able 6mths ago)

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-17<br>
<span>R2 D76</span></p> 

managed to learn about interfaces in #TypeScript but

even less productive than yesterday (-4% -16% makes -20% than 2d ago :D) according to stats, I passed 2h on socials

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-16<br>
<span>R2 D74-75</span></p> 

Diving in more #TypeScript : classes, inheritance, override, private/public properties, static props, abstract classes, getter/setter and more

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-14<br>
<span>R2 D73</span></p> 

Dived into types of various objects in #typescript and tsconfig file

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-13<br>
<span>R2 D72</span></p> 

Finished basics of #tdd

Started basics of #TypeScript and fell asleep

both things seem redundant and useful at the same time

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-12<br>
<span>R2 D71</span></p> 

Studied some more #tdd and #bdd with Mocha/Chai

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-11<br>
<span>R2 D70</span></p> 

Yeiiii! It's official! 
I made it, just got the contract! From 1st of July I will be a Backend developer (#NodeJS) !

Finally I can also say, if I made it , you can also make it!


***

<p class="datum">2020-04-09<br>
<span>R2 D69</span></p> 

Not done too much, starting #TypeScript and #tdd , both are very interesting

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-06<br>
<span>R2 D68</span></p> 

Couldn't help it, almost one hour coding in React the new website.
Added nested routing and so nested components in the Art section (CSSed too with flex). Missing show category items and after that, a modal for item/id

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-04<br>
<span>R2 D66-67</span></p> 

Updated/fixed my website according to feedback + added few stylish/content things + updated projects + upgrading CV now

***

<p class="datum">2020-04-02<br>
<span>R2 D65</span></p> 

didn't have much time. Started updating my page/portfolio with the new projects. Tomorrow:
1) I will ask you some feedback on that

<span>R2 D26</span></p> 

going to start building my wife's art website, using #Reactjs and #Firebase.

And going to share here and on my blog the results step by step.

My knowledge is limited so I'll learn things on the way.

I'll keep everything on a repo so if you want to suggest/advice/comment feel completely free, I'm eager to learn!

I'll start by sketching it on paper and maybe learning a little the famous Figma.

The website at the moment won't be commercial, so to make it quicker I won't use auth or payments...

also meanwhile I'm working fulltime so it won't be that quick, but I'll make little steps almost every day

Phase1: sketching and drafting. Chose the categories and made a first sketch of landing page... my wife has artistic tastes and I can't deviate from thatðŸ˜„ rough UX

Title will be very different and missing about etc sections

...made on Figma

<span>R2 D25</span></p> 

continued some tutorial 
but I think it's getting too much complex to learn simple concepts

I think I'll drop it to start learning through docs with mini projects

What's your approach?
