But in this case we don&#x27;t need that, just what will be in usernameInput.</p><p>Finally, we can access all our referenced properties, like the input value, this way: <code>usernameInput.current.value</code></p><p>In the next credit, it was needed to create a controlled input. A controlled input is an input field that is controlled by the component state. That means setting the value of the input by the state: <code> &lt;input ref={usernameInput} value={username} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;</code></p><p>Then, we can set the state at the top of the component: <code>const [username, setUsername] = useState(&#x27;&#x27;);</code>\nAnd finally, use that state to change the value of the input in the handleChange function. In this case, transforming every key to lowercase:</p><pre><code>const { value } = event.target;\nsetUsername(value.toLowerCase());\n</code></pre><p>So the flow is the following:\ninput from user --&gt; update input state --&gt; transforming input state -&gt; sending the state as value of the input --&gt; input appears on screens.</p><br/><h2 id=\"07-rendering-arrays\"><a href=\"#07-rendering-arrays\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>07: Rendering Arrays</h2><p>The exercises were just little demonstrations in this case, to show the importance of using a unique index key when showing elements in the DOM through a mapping. Not without, not with the pre-built index of the map function, but with a preset set of keys to use. This allows also React to keep the state of the inputs even with continuous rendering.</p><p>Not doing so is a mistake that leads to any kind of unpredictable behavior. I did this time ago and it also cost me many points in an interview.</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This is all for the Epic React Fundamentals section.
