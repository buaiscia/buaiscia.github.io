Between 15 and 19 years old I studied in a technical high-school. At that time the best part of the curriculum about Informatics (that's how it was called) was some coding in C++. I'm saying this not because it helped my actual career, but just the opposite.\nI didn't learn anything (the peak of knowledge was drawing with code some geometrical figures) and after school I forgot everything. I bought some C++ books at the time, but I got stuck at some concepts like pointers (geez I still remember those pages) and I was very bad at math. So the interest and curiosity about programming just died there.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"Fast forward, I took humanistic studies at the university, because I liked them more, and I was more prone and good at them.

But I was always willing to learn, even so because I had night shifts as well. I passed many uneventful hours to study (I did a short nap sometimes and I have also eaten though). At that time I didn't know what directions to take, not even which field to specialise on (I didn't even know devops was a thing), so I started with SQL and Unix command line.

As a matter of fact, in the next one I started from a so-called level 1.5. It was an intermediate level between service desk and level 2, which is basically operations and maintenance.

I didn't have access to the code itself of the applications (which were written in Java), only the exceptions and similar during the log analysis.`}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"However, the broad scope of the team allowed me and my colleagues to think about automating things, and we had free hand to use whatever was more fitting. So I started learning development, with Freecodecamp as initial resource, and complementing it with a course (just one? Yeah...) on Udemy. I finished the latter, but about the former I managed to go through the curriculum until the frontend projects. I didn't complete those one though, as it was about time to put knowledge into work-related projects (it also rhymes right?!).\"}),`\n`,(0,t.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"First and foremost I created my website with the tools I had.
