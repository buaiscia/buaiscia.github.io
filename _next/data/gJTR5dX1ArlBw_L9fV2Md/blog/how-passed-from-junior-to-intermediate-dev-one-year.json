So, on Twitter, I saw somebody posting about a full remote position, and I got in touch. Long story short, things moved very quickly, and I got the first interview and a take home project. Here comes the interesting thing. The project was about writing a vanilla JS program with an algorithm inside, as a backend part of a larger, hypothetical program.

I had to study the problem in the beginning, check something on the Internet about some ideas, but eventually I had the wow! moment. Then, I started creating everything around it: creating management of edge cases, some tests (the application was running on Node); commitlint and husky; the readme. That took me a lot longer than expected, maybe another 3 hours. And before sending it, I upgraded some dependencies for a test and all the application broke down. So I had to spend another 20 minutes or more fixing it. Basically, finding a way to roll back to the previous version. And no, I didn't commit just before that (rookie error).\"}),(0,e.jsx)(t.p,{children:\"So here there was the first lesson (for me): all my experience of the previous 10 months led to that project, which had much of my knowledge in it.
