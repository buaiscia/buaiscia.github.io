I wrote about it \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I specifically learnt in the one or two years of learning development were the basics, how to create something simple in a linear order, and some styling. I also learnt through examples and a lot of stack overflow \u0026#x27;investigation\u0026#x27; how to put things somehow together and make it work. A lot of copy paste not working and lots of sweat to make it work. Eventually, a big satisfaction of giving birth to something useful.\nI also learnt how to use databases and connect a backend to them and then to a frontend. Enough to try take-home projects for the interviews and fail almost all of them. But as they say, it takes one to make it worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"one-month-before-the-job-starts\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#one-month-before-the-job-starts\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOne month before the job starts\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I got hired, I did what was not \u0026#x27;explicitally\u0026#x27; requested but I think is a good approach (especially for your future self). I got in touch with my future colleagues so they could tell me what I should improve, or what tech stack should I add to my knowledge before the first day of work. Of course it\u0026#x27;s all theoretical because you don\u0026#x27;t really know anything about the project you\u0026#x27;ll work on. But having a good starting point saves you a lot of time in the first month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my case was especially Typescript. I never used it before so I took the opportunity, documentation always opened, to take a brief Udemy course and transform everything to Typescript in my take-home assignment that I made for my initial interview.\nI had a list of technologies used by the team to check upon; I had maybe knowledge of two thirds of them but good enough skills on one third. The rest I just remotely heard they were existing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-first-three-months\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-first-three-months\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThe first three months\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow would I describe it? At least overwhelming. Where I live, since you start a new position, usually you enter a three months period called trial or probation period, in which, in theory, you and the company have to decided whether you\u0026#x27;re a good fit to each other. And each other have the right to leave you in the street with 2 weeks notice. I know that\u0026#x27;s a lot less stressful than other countries (AFAIK the US for example where the 2 weeks are a permanent notice time) but still, that makes this time particularly sensitive. Especially passing from a senior position (my previous) to a junior one where I had to prove myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt came to the first days where, apart from the initial setup, I had to get familiar with the codebase I had to work on.\nAnd then...apart from one small ticket for a small change, I was given the assignment to r-e-f-a-c-t-o-r the whole codebase. ðŸ¤¯\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat one came from some older vendor and was taken by my company which improved it a little and added the requested features. But it was over complicated, with lots of useless code. So yeah, they told me, just rewrite it from scratch using Typescript.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI confess I had my moments of panick. Frustration, impatience, other negative feelings here and there. Especially with the first PRs (pull requests) which were reviewed with tons of comments on how to do things differently, or change code, or delete parts and remake others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell guess what? It was the best exercise ever. It allowed me to know from top to bottom the code, and slowly slowly improving the quality of my programming, applying DRY and SOLID principles, algorithms, and so on. Sometimes I had to remake things 3 or 4 times before having a good version. Eventually, for that particular project, I had just few, more \u0026#x27;coding style\u0026#x27; corrections. That doesn\u0026#x27;t mean I write code as good as my colleagues -yet - but it\u0026#x27;s an amazing progress for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, this wouldn\u0026#x27;t have been possible if I wouldn\u0026#x27;t have the most understanding colleagues, which are experienced and patient with all my questions and misunderstandings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"some-of-the-lessons-learnt\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#some-of-the-lessons-learnt\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"icon icon-link\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003eSome of the lessons learnt\u003c/h2\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eHave patience with yourself.
